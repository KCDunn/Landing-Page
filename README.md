# Landing-Page

Assignment: Landing Page
Create a flask project capable of handling the following routes:

localhost:5000/    This route should serve a view file called index.html and display a greeting.
localhost:5000/ninjas    This route should serve a view file called ninjas.html and display information about ninjas.
localhost:5000/dojos/new    This route should serve a view file called dojos.html and have a form be sent to - action=' '.
Now create a folder inside of our project labeled static. Remember, this static folder will be used to serve all of our static content (stylesheets, images, javascript files, etc.)! Now try placing a stylesheet in the static folder and referencing it in our view files (templates).
